name: test-harness-acapy-dotnet
# Summary
#
# This test run uses the current main branch of ACA-Py for all of the agents except Bob (holder),
# which uses the master branch of Aries Framework .NET. It skips tests that are known not to work with
# the Aries Framework .NET as the holder, notably those that involve Proof Proposals and DID Exchange (RFC0023).
#
# Current
# 
# We currently have four tests failing that appear to be tests that use RFC0023 DID Exchange, which
# is not supported.  This is an issue with tagging in the test suite, and is an expected failure. Issue #169
# submitted to the Aries Agent Test Harness.
